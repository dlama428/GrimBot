1:My divining eye is hazy. Can't see a damn thing about your question.
2:Must you pester me with such banal lines of inquiry?
3:Don't you have better things to do, like sweeping...something?
4:*Hnn.* Your answer is no. No. And definitely no.
5:Indubitably.
6:Without a doubt.
7:A charming question, but the answer is no.
8:There is a chance. But that chance is slim.
9:The odds look better than most. But don't do anything you'll regret.
10:What you should *really* ask is \"What would Grimthorpe do?\"
11:Note likely.
12:I doubt it.
13:I'd bet my front teeth on it.
14:Don't bet your bones on it.
15:I'd say there's no such thing as obtuse questions, but you've proven me wrong.
16:If I had a nose, I'd say your question reeks. Ask me something else.
17:My divining eyes sees much, and right now it sees a nosy ne'er-do-well!
18:If you grease a few palms.
19:Maybe in a few weeks. Or years.
20:Listen to your hear...if its beating, *you're alive*.
21:I didn't know you cared!
22:If I had a gold piece for every time a body asked that question...
23:You already know the answer.
24:Cognelis knows the answer.
25:Sophrenia knows the answer.
26:Galmthea knows the answer, but be careful poking around *that* one. She's a loon! Also. Also, she used up my best soap.
27:Try asking ____.
28:Have you spoken to ____ about this?
29:Yes, but the *route* to your answer isn't as simple.
30:Possibly, but it isn't set in stone.
31:What a perplexing question! I need time to ponder on it.
32:I'd like to tell you yes, but I'm in a foul mood, so the answer is no.
33:Yes. I'd explain why, but I'm not convinced you'd comprehend.
34:Must I spell it out for you? Y. E. S.
35:One wonders about people who ask such questions. But lucky for you, I've a soft spot for the dim-witted fleshlings. So the answer is yes.
36:I fear the answer is no. I'd like to offer you a better answer, but I'm a floating skull. Not a miracle worker.
37:No, but you'll get the answer you want eventually. You always do. That's what you wanted to hear, yes?
38:That's a tough question...Ask me later.
39:...Perhaps.
40:I think you've struck gold here. Not only is the answer yes, but there's a surprise coming your way.
41:*YEEEEEEEEEEEEEES.* Is that clear enough for you? If not, I reserve the right to tell you what I *really* think.
42:If I say yes, will you still respect me in the morning? Oh bugger all; its yes anyway.
43:Are you sure you wish to know the answer? Too late now. It's no.
44:You're the 58th person to ask me that today, and the answer is still no. You should really try to be more original.
45:*Bwahaha!* You'll have to pardon me; your question is simply hilarious. When would you ever get a \"yes\" to a question like that? *Really!*
